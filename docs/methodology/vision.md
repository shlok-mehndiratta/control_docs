# Computer Vision Module

## Objective
To detect:
- The UGV (via ArUco markers)
- Road boundaries from aerial imagery

## Progress
- Implemented ArUco detection using OpenCV.
- Began camera calibration for accurate pose estimation.
- Conducted preliminary tests on line segmentation.

## Next Steps
- Improve robustness under varying lighting conditions.
- Integrate vision outputs into the ROS data pipeline.
- Begin testing with simulated drone camera feeds.
