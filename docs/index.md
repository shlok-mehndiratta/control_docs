# Cooperative Aerial-Ground Guidance System

This site documents the development of a cooperative UAV–UGV system based on the work of Santos et al. The objective is to enable a ground robot without onboard sensors to navigate solely using aerial visual feedback from a drone.

The documentation includes:
- High-level project overview  
- Explanation of simulation, vision, and control modules  
- Monthly development logs  
- Challenges and solutions  
- Future roadmap  

This makes the project accessible even to readers with no robotics background.
